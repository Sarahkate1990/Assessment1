	   <h2>Overview</h2>
	   </i>Tool used - UDK (Unreal Development Kit)</i>
<br>My project idea is a mobile device game designed for children and adults who struggle with a language delay. 
<br>Using a 2D side-scroller platform, the players character can run and collect items, during the gameplay special items can be collected which will them prompt a display asking the player to repeat phrases and sounds, once the task has been completed correctly the user is rewarded the special item and can then continue on with the game. 
<br>This game will have different levels, starting from basic pronunciation of letters, to harder levels that involve stringing words together with sounds and blending into sentences.

	   <h2>Motivation</h2>
<br>As a parent of a child who struggles with a language delay, I have seen first hand the difficulties and frustrations that my child suffers, and being 7 years old with the speech patterns of a 4 year old, my son gets bullied a lot and gets discouraged from doing his speech exercises.
<br>Like most kids his age, he loves playing mobile games. This is why I have come up with the idea of a mobile phone game that is designed to assist children, and adults alike, with learning speech and sounds whilst in a fun game format. 

	   <h2>Description</h2>
<br>This project has the potential to be expanded and possibly be incorporated into a school and professional setting with learning tools for students, parents, teachers and professionals such as; Paediatricians, Speech Pathologists and Doctors etc. 
<br>Many adults and children in Australia, and around the world, suffer from speech issues and for children it can be especially difficult for them to be motivated and willing to sit and practice their sounds and words. Having a form of motivation such as this game can be a fun and an encouraging way to help assist these kids whilst having fun and not feeling overwhelmed.

	   <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<br>For this project I would be using UDK ( Unreal Development Kit) which is a free version of the Unreal engine that can be used by developers, educators, and students to create a wide variety of games and interactive software.
<br>This application will require a working smartphone device with updated OS software
