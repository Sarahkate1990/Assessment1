<br>Since I was a kid I have always grown up with Information Technology, my father used to take me to computer shows with him and we would look at all the different computer parts. 
<br>My dad would tell me about them and taught me how they were used. This sparked a great interest and from there I began researching other areas, Web Development in particular. 
<br>At the age of 17 I left highschool and studied IT at TAFE NSW. I never got to finish any of the certificates, but that didn’t change my mind about IT. 
<br>Many years later, after a lot of up’s and down’s here I am at RMIT pursuing my goals and on the path to becoming a Website Developer.
