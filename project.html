<h3>Tool used - <i>UDK (Unreal Development Kit)</i></h3>
My project idea is a mobile device game designed for children and adults who struggle with speech issues. 
<br>Using a 2D side-scroller platform, the players character can run and collect items, during the gameplay special items can be collected which will them prompt a display asking the player to repeat phrases and sounds, once the task has been completed correctly the user is rewarded the special item and can then continue on with the game. 
<br>This game will have different levels, starting from basic pronunciation of letters, to harder levels that involve stringing words together with sounds and blending into sentences.

<h3>Why do I think it is important or interesting</h3>
As a parent of a child who struggles with a language delay, I have seen first hand the difficulties and frustrations that my child suffers, and being 7 years old with the speech patterns of a 4 year old, my son gets bullied a lot and gets discouraged from doing his speech exercises.
<br>Like most kids his age, he loves playing mobile games. This is why I have come up with the idea of a mobile phone game that is designed to assist children, and adults alike, with learning speech and sounds whilst in a fun game format. 

<h3>Description</h3>
Using a 2D side-scroller platform, the players character can run and collect items, during the gameplay special items can be collected which will them prompt a display asking the player to repeat phrases and sounds, once the task has been completed correctly the user is rewarded the special item and can then continue on with the game. 
<br>This game will have different levels, starting from basic pronunciation of letters, to harder levels that involve stringing words together with sounds and blending into sentences.
<br>This project has the potential to be expanded and possibly be incorporated into a school and professional setting with learning tools for students, parents, teachers and professionals such as; Paediatricians, Speech Pathologists and Doctors etc.
