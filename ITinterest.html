<br>Since I was a kid I have always grown up with Information Technology, my father used to take me to computer shows with him and we would look at all the different computer parts. 
<br>My dad would tell me about them and taught me how they were used. This sparked a great interest and from there I began researching other areas, Web Development in particular. 
<br>At the age of 17 I left highschool and studied IT at TAFE NSW. I never got to finish any of the certificates, but that didn’t change my mind about IT. 
<br>Many years later, after a lot of up’s and down’s here I am at RMIT pursuing my goals and on the path to becoming a Website Developer.
<p>
	<br>
In 2007, I decided to study at TAFE instead of continuing on to year 11, and there I studied a Certificate III in Information Technology (applications) to explore the industry a little bit and get a bit more knowledge. 
<br>I really enjoyed this course, especially learning about websites. This sparked a great interest in web development when we were given an assignment to build a web page using only css/html. My webpage received 85% marks and this gave me a lot of confidence and thus started my passion for web development.
<p>
	<br>In 2011 I continued on to study a Certificate IV in Information Technology (websites), and my love for IT and Websites grew even more. I thought about studying for a Bachelor of IT but this would require a year 12 certificate and an ATAR ranking, 
<br>which both I did not have, so i enrolled into an open foundation course at The University of Newcastle, but unfortunately due to personal life issues and mental health I was unable to continue.
<br>Since then, I have moved around a lot and had 2 kids, which put any career plans on hold for a few years. Luckily this year in 2020 I stumbled across an advertisement on social media for Open Universities so I decided to enquire about the Bachelor of IT. 
<br> This is when they introduced me to RMIT online foundation units, and I must say it has been the best thing that happen this year and I am so excited and proud to be on this journey, finally working towards my dream of studying for a Bachelor of IT.
